function [freq,T,amp,alpha] = Jan25_TLSMPM1995(x,cut_off)

% STEP 1: APPLY TO THE WHOLE SIGNAL IN A LOOP THROUGH ALL "N" points in "x"

% function [freq,amp,flag,relres] = matrixpencil(x,cut_off) outputs the
% convergence "flag" and residual norm ("relres") as found from the least
% squares soltuion for amplitudes using the LSQR function.


% -- Total Least Squares Matrix Pencil Method --
% ------ Implementation by: Sara Makboul -------

% Sarkar, T. K., & Pereira, O. (1995).
% Using the matrix pencil method to estimate the parameters
% of a sum of complex exponentials. IEEE Antennas and 
% Propagation Magazine, 37(1), 48â€“55. doi:10.1109/74.370583

% HOW TO:
% 0) Call on the current executing function in the command prompt:
% 0.5) "[freq,amp,varargout] = matrixpencil(x,cut_off)" and include:
% 1) input signal as vector "x"
% 2) input p (significant digits) for noise removal as the "cut_off" 


%%

% setting default value (p=5) for "cut_off" if not specificed in the input:
% "data accurate up to  p (cut_off) = ___ significant decimal digits"

if nargin == 1
    cut_off = 5;
end

%%

% setting "N": number of equally spaced points, as the length of the x
% signal vector:

N = length(x);

% setting "L": pencil parameter (anywhere between N/3 to N/2)
% ceil() rounds up to next larget integer:

L = ceil(N/3);

% OR (for larger L, use):
% L = (N/2) - 1; 
% OR:
% L = floor(N/3);

%%

% Hankel data matrix Y:
% ( N - L ) X ( L + 1)
% Hankel matrix: symmetric and constant across the anti-diagonals
% Hankel(c,r) makes first column: c and last row: r
% doesn't add the "__ -1"

Y = x(hankel(1:N-L, N-L:N));

% OR: Y = hankel(x(1:N-L),x(N-L:N)); ));

%%

% Hankel Singular Value Decomposition (HSVD)

% Performs an SVD on the Hankel matrix Y

% Then, returns the (N-L) largest singular values = #.
% Note: S represents the sigma E diagonal matrix with the singular values.

[U,S,V] = svds(Y, N-L);

%%

% For M determination, and simultaneous denoising

% "diag()" returns a column vector of the main diagonal elements of S (E)
% these are the singular values:

singval = diag(S);

% The Max singular value is at the top (descending order):

maxsingval = singval(1);

% Assessing ratio of each singular value (in the column vector) to the
% largest singular value ("maxsingval")
% Then, uses the negative of the # of significant decimal digits in the 
% data (p), set as the "cut_off" during input, as the 'tolerance factor'.
% And if the if statement is true, the singular value is NOISE.

% M is defined!

for indx = 2:L
    M = indx;
    if log10(abs(singval(indx)/maxsingval)) < -cut_off
        break;
    end
end

%%

% Finding [E'] (sigma), [V'], and [U']:
% [E'] has only M colums corresponding to M dominant singular values
% "clear" erases an array.


Sp(1:M,1:M) = S(1:M,1:M);
clear S;

Vp = V(:,1:M);
clear V;

Up = U(:,1:M);
clear U;

%%

% The size of Vp is computed, and presented in separate variables: c and r:
% c = columns; r = rows

[c,r] = size(Vp)


% Removing last row from [V'] to create [V1']:

Vp1T = Vp(1:r-1,:);

% Removing first row from [V'] to create [V2']:

Vp2T = Vp(2:r,:);


% [Y1] and [Y2]
% created after SVD, from SVD's noise-filtered, and reconstructed matrices.
% Complex conjugate transpose (^H) to [V1'] and [V2'] denoted with (') 
% is applied to (Vp1T) and (Vp2T):

Y1 = Up*Sp*((Vp1T)');

Y2 = Up*Sp*((Vp2T)');

clear Up;
clear Sp;
clear Vp;

%%

% pinv() represents the Moore-Penrose pseudoinverse taken on [Y1]:

% And 'balance' option enabled to improve the conditioning of the matrices
% The balance option will produce more accurate results (usually).
% BUT,  if the matrices contain nonzero integers AND small values,
% balancing may scale the small values to make them as significant 
% as the integers and produce inaccurate results. In that case:'nobalance'

% z (signal pole) is defined!

z = eig(pinv(Y1)*Y2,'balance');

% Extracting angular frequency (w) from signal pole (z):
% log() is the natural logarithm ln()
% ! MAY NEED to take absolute value of angfreq after if dont want (-)Freq :

angfreq = log(z)/(sqrt(-1));

% divide by imaginary i as seen above... OR do 2 steps:: 
% angfreq = log(z)
% angfreq = imag(angfreq); 


% Take the complex conjugate:
% ! MAY NEED to just divide by the time step (dt) if this doesn't function:

angfreq = conj(angfreq);


% REAL FREQUENCY (f) EXTRACTED! (not angular or complex):

freq = angfreq/(2*pi);

% Converted Real Freq to Period (T = 1/f):

T = 1./(freq);

%%

% Extracting damping coefficient ("alpha") from signal pole (z)
% MAY BE INCORRECT! also: (check if negative with "-()".)

alpha = -(real(log(z)));

%%

% ones() creates an array ("A") of ones with the dimensions (__,__):
% this is the first column of the Z matrix:

A = ones(N, length(z));


% Creating the rest of the Z ("A") matrix:

for indx = 2:N
    A(indx,:) = A(indx-1,:).*z.';
end

% Least Squares Problem: solution for amplitude ("amp"):
% Where flag and relres values currently not needed and replaced by "~":
% relres = Relative residual norm
% flag = convergence flag

% Apply Moore-Penrose inverse to Z ("A") matrix using "pinv()":
% x.' is the column vector representing the signal x

% Amplitude extracted!

[amp,~,~] = lsqr(A,x.',[],[],[],[],pinv(A)*(x.'));

% Where:
% 1st [] = tolerance of method --> default = 1e-6
% 2nd [] = maximum number of iterations
% 3rd [] = M1 --> default is no preconditioner
% 4th [] = M2 --> default is no preconditioner

% For display and curve-fitting purposes.


% Create the matrix of exponential decays in each mode and solve to find
% the contribution of each mode

% create matrix of 0's initially:

% Where: N = signal length initially. M = dominant modes signal REDUCED to

for c = 1:N
    for m = 1:M
